This is one of my first attempts to use React. All credits go to Stephen Grider and his awesome 
[course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

If you want to dive deeper and really learn React and Redux, I suggest you take some online tutorials :+1

### Getting Started

Just clone the repo, open it in your favourite IDE, look around, I made sure to comment as much as possible to make it clear.
If you don't know where to start, it's probably better to head into ```src/components/app.js```

```
> git clone https://github.com/Sashkan/ft_youtube.git
> cd ft_youtube
> npm install
> npm start
```
